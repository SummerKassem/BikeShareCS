# BikeShare Case-Study

This repository contains the data analysis performed for a Bike Sharing case-study. The data belongs to a company that has two kinds of users: annual members and casual riders. The aim of the marketing team target is to convert casual riders into annual members in the next campaign. Thus, the goal of the study was to identify how annual members and casual riders use the bikes differently in order to provide the marketing team with insights. The data on which the analysis was carried out is from January-December 2023 and was downloaded from [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

The library Pandas from Python was used to perform the analysis, and Matplotlib was used to plot the results. In this repository you can find the following:
* The code can be found in the Jupyter Notebook [here](https://github.com/SummerKassem/BikeShareCS/blob/main/PythonCode/bike_share_analysis.ipynb). 
* A step-by-step explanation of the data analysis process can be found in a report [here](https://github.com/SummerKassem/BikeShareCS/blob/main/Report/Report.pdf).
* The resulting visualisations of the performed data analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/SummerKassem/BikeShareCS/tree/main/Visualisations)

The results that were produced using Python, were also reproduced using MySQL:
* The queries can be here in the Notebook [here](https://github.com/SummerKassem/BikeShareCS/blob/main/SQL/bike_share_analysis_sql.ipynb)
* The results of the queries were saved to .csv files [here](https://github.com/SummerKassem/BikeShareCS/tree/main/SQL/results)
