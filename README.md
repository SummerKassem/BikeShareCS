# BikeShare Case-Study

This repository contains the data analysis performed for a Bike Sharing case-study. The data belongs to a company that has two kinds of users: annual members and casual riders. The aim of the marketing team target is to convert casual riders into annual members in the next campaign. Thus, the goal of the study was to identify how annual members and casual riders use the bikes differently in order to provide the marketing team with insights. The data on which the analysis was carried out is from January-December 2023 and was downloaded from [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
