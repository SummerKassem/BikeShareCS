\title{Bike-Share Case Study}
\date{}
\maketitle

This report provides the results and step-step explanation of the analysis performed for data from a bike-sharing company. The data belongs to a bike-sharing company that has two kinds of users: annual members and casual riders. The goal of the case-study was to identify how annual members and casual riders use the bikes differently in order to help the stake-holders decide whether or not to target converting casual riders into annual members in the next marketing campaign. The data about the bike-rides used in this case-study was between January-November 2023, each month was stored in a csv file, and was downloaded from \href{https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html}{https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html}.

\section*{Data cleaning:}
The code that was used to perform the data cleaning can be found in the Jupyter Notebook \textcolor{red}{cleaning.ipynb}
